# handwriting_recognition

The repo provides models to recognize handwritten dates in an image file. 

In the 'segment_algorithm' folder, an algorithm based on character segmentation and CNN is provided. 

In the 'cnn_rnn_model' folder, an algorithm based on CNN-RNN and without character segmentation is provided. 

In the 'detection_model' folder, 'EAST' model ('frozen_east_text_detection.pb') is saved for text area detection.
